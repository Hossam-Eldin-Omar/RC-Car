## Description:
This project is a mobile-controlled delivery car that combines convenience with security.
It features a servo motor-operated delivery box that is unlocked by entering a password via a keypad on the car's built-in LCD screen.
One of the standout features of the car is its autonomous return functionality, allowing it to navigate back to its starting point either when the connection is lost or via a command from the mobile app.

## Key Features:
• Mobile-Controlled Movement: The car is controlled via a mobile application that allows for easy navigation and interaction.
• Password-Protected Box: The delivery box is secured with a password system, which can be entered through the car's keypad and displayed on the LCD screen.
• Servo Motor Operation: The servo motor controls the locking and unlocking of the box.
• Autonomous Return Function: The car has the ability to autonomously navigate back to its starting location if the connection is lost or when triggered by the app.
• LCD Display: Real-time status and password entry are shown on the LCD screen.
• Keypad Input: The keypad allows the user to enter a password to unlock the delivery box.

## How It Works:
1. The car is controlled via the mobile app, which sends commands to navigate the car.
2. The delivery box can only be unlocked by entering the correct password through the keypad.
3. If the connection is lost, the car automatically navigates back to its starting point using its autonomous return feature.
4.The app also allows for manual return by tapping a button, which triggers the car's return.
